/*

This file should be in /client, not here. However, we have to put it here due
to a bug in the Vetur plugin for VS Code, which supplies Intellisense to .vue
files. It only looks for `tsconfig.json` in the root of the project directory,
so we have to put it here.

See https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/815.
