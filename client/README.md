# Client

## Development setup

First, install the "Current" version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

Then install dependencies:

```
$ cd client
$ npm ci
```

Finally, run `$ npm start` to run the development server. Or run `$ npm run build` to build the production version (to be checked in).

## Recommended editor setup

I strongly recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Install the Vetur extension (View > Extensions). After installing, click the
gear icon
